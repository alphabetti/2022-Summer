## Getting Started
1. Install and Register for GitHub
2. Install PyCharm
3. Get this _Notebook_ and open it in your pycharm
4. Start to Code!

### Registering for GitHub and installing Git
(GitHub)[http://www.github.com] is a place where developers store code and discuss stuff.  Storing it in places like this means you don't lose it when your computer dies, and you can regularly save your changes in a way you can rewind, and also get advice from other people, as well as share cool stuff with other people.

We're not really going to be doing much with GitHub just yet, but it's a good idea to get an account on there.

* Go to (GitHub)[http://www.github.com] and set up an account
* You should also install git on your machine.  Git is the version control software used for that cool rewind stuff I mentioned earlier.  There are instructions (here)[https://github.com/git-guides/install-git]

### Installing PyCharm
Code is generally just written in text, and stuff (an interpreter, a compiler) runs that code to make it useful.  However, there are really powereful Integrated Development Environments (IDE)s out there which will make it a lot easier to write code, provide suggestions, allow easy editing of code and so on.  We're going to be working with python for this project, and PyCharm is one of the best IDEs for it.  It's produced by a company called JetBrains and a lot of commercial companies buy this product.  However - great news you don't have to buy it, you get it free as a student, you just need to sign up with your bms email address.

(Install PyCharm)[https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/] setting up a new account with your bms email.

### Installing this Repository onto your machine
* Let Daki know your GitHub account name and I'll permission you access to this repository (think of it as an area where all code for one project, in this case the 2022-Summer coding exercises are stored).  You can then install it locally.

* Navigate to the repository area at [Daki's GitHub](https://github.com/alphabetti/2022-Summer)
* Click on the button at the top right labelled 'fork' and click on `Create Fork`.  This will make a copy of the repository in your own GitHub.  Changes to this repository are now detached from the original repository (though you can propose that they get merged back in!)
* Once you've created the fork, you can download it to your machine. _You'll likely need to grab Daki for this bit'_
* Click on the big green 'Code' button at the top right of your forked repo in GitHub, and click on the copy icon next to what looks like a web address
* Make a new folder on your machine called 'Code'
* Open a shell and navigate to that folder (if the folder is open in explorer you can type in 'cmd' in the top bar of that folder to do this)
* in the shell window type in `git clone ` then paste in the web address from above
* GitHub will pull the code in locally, and it will now be available on your machine.
* Open up PyCharm, and point to the directory you've just made.  You can then open up the _Notebooks_ directory and open up `learn_python.pynb`

### Installing Jupyter
* Ths learn python file is what is called a _Jupyter Notebook_, you need to install a tool called Jupyter to be able to use these.  (Follow the Instructions At)[https://blog.finxter.com/how-to-install-jupyter-notebook-on-pycharm/]
