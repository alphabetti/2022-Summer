    "# Write the game of Mastermind\n",
    "We've got Mastermind upstairs - see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)\n",
    "For this the computer will randomly select a sequence of numbers, and we guess a sequence of numbers, from this we're told if we're\n",
    "1) right\n",
    "2) For each number which is in the correct position and shows the right value we return \"Completely Right\"\n",
    "3) For each number remaining in both clue and answer which is not in the correct position we return \"Wrong Position\"\n",
    "4) Everything else is completely wrong\n",
    "\n",
    "The tricky bit in this is writing the logic which works out if our guess is right or not.\n",
    "When writing this sort of code it is best to write tests for your code.  We're going to use an approach called \"TDD\" or Test Driven Development\n",
    "We check all our tests are coming back good.  We write a new test and check it's broken, then we fix it as easily as possibly, then we check everything is good again and repeat.  By writing tests before we code we guarantee that what we're writing will be right."
