    "# Blackjack\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we're going to teach the computer to play BlackJack, and see if we can get it to win against a standard 'House' you might find in a casino'.  Blackjack is one of the games that you can play at a Casino with the lowest \"House Edge\" - of 0.5% in the house's favour.  But don't be fooled, as with all Casino games if you keep playing you'll upltimately lose money.\n",

    "## Introduction to Blackjack\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A stake of $1 is bet to play the hand\n",
    "2. The Dealer / House plays one card face up for the player, and one card face down for itself\n",
    "3. The Dealer deals one face up card to the player's pile, and one more to themselves (the player has two face up, dealer has one face up, one face down)\n",
    "4. Player chooses to add a card \"Hit\" or \"Stick\".  They repeat this until they Stick or they Bust\n",
    "5. The player's card total is the sum of their cards - honour cards (Jack, Queen, King) all count as 10.  Aces can either be treated as 11, or as a 1.  If the total count exceeds 21 then they are Busy and immediately lose the hand and their stake.\n",
    "6. The dealer plays their hand.  They reveal their second card and follows a standard rule of - if they have 17 or more in any way they stick, otherwise they Hit.  As with players, if they exceed 21, they Bust and immediately lose the hand\n",
    "7. \"Black Jack\" is called when a player draws a 10 value card and an Ace - this basically means their hand is worth 21 and can't be improved on\n",
    "8. If both player and Dealer are still in, whoever has the highest number wins the hand.  If this is the player they receive their stake back and the same amount again.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Now let's write the code\n",
    "We want the computer to count as the dealer.  We'll just play a single hand for the moment.\n",
    "You can simulate what card is received by using a random number between 1 and 14, let's not worry about the fact the cards are drawn from a deck just yet.\n"
