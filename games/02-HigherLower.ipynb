    "The _time complexity_ of an algorithm is a way of measuring how long it will take (often measured in instructions executed) for the code to run with different data, and we always take the worst case result.\n",
    "In the case we're running, we're looking at a number of potential outcomes of 10.  At its worst we pick the number 10 and we guess 10 times.  If we increased the number of potential outcomes to 100 (guess in the range 1 to 100), then it would be 100.  _n_ is used to denote the number of outcomes we have to process - the number of guesses we need to make is proporional to the number of outcomes, so that means the solution is O(n) (announced as _order n_).\n",
    "\n",
    "If instead we split the list into exactly half, we have 10, then 5, then 2, then 1 outcome when we're checking.  This is less steps and actually comes out as O(log to base 2 of n).  As logs are all proportional, this is described as O(log n) (announced as _order log n_)\n",
    "\n",
    "If we split the list in half each time then we'd end up taking just 10 guesses to find the correct result in a list of 1000 (2^10, 2 to the power 10 is 1024 which is greater than 1000)\n",
    "\n",
    "There's also another complexity called _space complexity_ which is how much storage space the algorithm needs.  In our case we only have a couple of variables, so the space complexity is O(1).  It doesn't increase as the number of potential right answers increases.\n"
