# Using pygame to write games

When I started writing computer games, I did it in assembler, you had to physically write pixels to screen, you had to manage everything at a microscopic level by pushing values into and out of registers.  I ended up writing dedicated code to render my walls at all scales to make my code as fast as possible.

These days, computers are much faster, and the chances are someone has already done the heavy lifting for you.  For 3D games there are games libraries out there that handle most of the basics, such as Unity (used for Overcooked) and the Unreal engine (used for Minecraft Dungeons I think)

We're going to use an existing library called _pygame_ to start writing some more advanced 2D games.

There's an official primer at https://realpython.com/pygame-a-primer/ which you can work through

Or you can work through my examples in this category, they're each in their own notebook
