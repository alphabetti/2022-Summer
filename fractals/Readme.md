# About Fractals

For more details on anything here do check on wikipedia.  Quoting from there:

> In mathematics, fractal is a term used to describe geometric shapes containing detailed structure at arbitrarily small scales, usually having a fractal dimension strictly exceeding the topological dimension. Many fractals appear similar at various scales, as illustrated in successive magnifications of the Mandelbrot set.[1][2][3][4] This exhibition of similar patterns at increasingly smaller scales is called self-similarity, also known as expanding symmetry or unfolding symmetry; if this replication is exactly the same at every scale, as in the Menger sponge,[5] the shape is called affine self-similar. Fractal geometry lies within the mathematical branch of measure theory.

Huh?  OK well there's a lot going on here, but we want to focus on drawing something cool.  Take a look at

We keep zooming in, but we seem more and more detail as we zoom in.  These images are all generated by maths (this is a Mandelbrot Set), and we're going to recreate this.

Forget programming for now, we can start off by drawing our own fractals, by hand:

Once you're ready to do some programming to create fractal images, open up one of the Notebooks in this folder.
